# RoadscapeNet-A-Convolutional-Neural-Network-Approach-for-Automated-Road-Feature-Recognition-


We propose the development of a sophisticated Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture tailored specifically for the task of road feature classification in images. By leveraging advanced deep learning techniques, our model will be trained to accurately distinguish between different road attributes such as curbs, guardrails, sidewalks, and more. Through meticulous data preprocessing and model optimization, we aim to create a robust system capable of reliably identifying and categorizing diverse road features, thereby facilitating improved understanding and analysis of urban environments.
